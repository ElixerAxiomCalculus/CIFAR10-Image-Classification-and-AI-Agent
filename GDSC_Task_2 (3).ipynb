        "An AI Agent with **RAG and Function Calling** is an intelligent system that is able to comprehend and reply based on external knowledge and its computational capacity. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** improves the response of the agent by searching for relevant information from a knowledge base prior to sending a reply, which becomes more correct and accurate. **Function Calling** enables the AI agent to perform special operations, such as performing mathematics, summarizing data, or interacting with APIs for particular tasks. These features combined enable the AI agent to reason, so it can process user requests, gather useful information, and perform logical or mathematical operations at will, making it faster and context-sensitive."

        "In this step, we are installing the necessary libraries that will help us build our AI agent. The llama-index library allows us to efficiently manage and retrieve information from large text-based documents, while llama-index-readers-file helps in reading and processing files as input. We are also installing llama-index-embeddings-huggingface, which enables the use of Hugging Face embeddings—mathematical representations of words and sentences that make them understandable to AI models. Additionally, we include the transformers library, which provides access to pre-trained AI models like Meta’s Llama 3. Lastly, we install langchain, a framework designed to create AI agents with reasoning and retrieval capabilities. Running this command ensures that all these essential tools are available in our Google Colab notebook for further development."
